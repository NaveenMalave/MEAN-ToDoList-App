# MEAN-ToDoList-App
MEAN Stack
The MEAN stack is a JavaScript-based framework for developing scalable web applications.
The term MEAN is an acronym for MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node â€” the four key
technologies that make up the layers of the technology stack.
MongoDB - A NoSQL, object-oriented database designed for use with cloud applications.
Express(.js) - A web application framework for Node(.js) that supports interactions between
the front end (e.g., the client side) and the database.
Angular - Often referred to as the â€œfront end"; a client-side JavaScript framework used to
create dynamic web applications to work with interactive user interfaces.
Node(.js) - The premier JavaScript web server used to build scalable network applications.
## The To-Do-List App is to be implemented using MEAN stack technologies.
